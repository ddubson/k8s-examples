The book was generally very well received as a fast-paced space opera with a morally ambiguous hero and lots of grand scenery and devices. Kirkus Reviews described it as "Overextended and jarring", but "imaginative and gripping in places."

Banks said in an interview:
 There's a big war going on in that novel, and various individuals and groups manage to influence its outcome. But even being able to do that doesn't ultimately change things very much. At the book's end, I have a section pointing this out by telling what happened after the war, which was an attempt to pose the question, 'What was it all for?' I guess this approach has to do with my reacting to the clich√© of SF's 'lone protagonist.' You know, this idea that a single individual can determine the direction of entire civilizations. It's very, very hard for a lone person to do that. And it sets you thinking what difference, if any, it would have made if Jesus Christ, or Karl Marx or Charles Darwin had never been. We just don't know.
